# Hi people from Scandiweb!
I'm Federico Andres and I've been working on this React Junior Challenge for the lasts 20 days. 

I do know that it's quite unfinished but the point is almost there. I've decided to deliver as is because I don't want to delay it any further. 

<strong>Please don't take this bad</strong>. I've put all the time I could in order to finish and I think I will continue whenever I can.

Also, I know there are lots of "mistakes", or things that could have been coded way better. 

I got to say that I loved learning and understanding <strong>GraphQL</strong> and I enjoyed working with <strong>React Class Components</strong>, as well as working in the challenge itself.

Thank you for this opportunity. I hope you find it somehow interesting. And really hoping to hear back from you!

Cheers, Federico.
